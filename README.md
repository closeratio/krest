# Krest

Krest is a Kotlin-based REST API documentation generator which uses Java's reflection APIs to inspect the endpoints provided by a web application and generate documentation based on their definitions.

Krest is planned to include:

* Automatic classpath/package scanning for REST endpoint configurations
* Compatibility with multiple REST frameworks including:
	* Spring 4 + 5
	* Dropwizard
* HTML documentation generation
* RAML generation
* Swagger generation
